# Miscellaneous Communication Implementations
Miscellaneous assignments from IITK Course EE320: Principles of Communication:

* Envelope detector
* Costas loop
* Lloyd Max Quantizer

MATLAB/Octave is required to run these files.

# Deployment
## Envelope detector
Run ```env_detect.m```.

## Costas loop
Run ```costas.m``` by replacing your modulated signal file name in the third line.

## Lloyd Max Quantizer
The code is meant to run for two signal data files one by one. Keep ```lloyd.m```, ```m_given_v.m```, ```pdf.m``` and ```v_given_m.m``` in the same folder and run ```lloyd.m```. Change the starting for loop with ```fil``` variable according to number of data files, and change the file name(s) in the succeeding line.
